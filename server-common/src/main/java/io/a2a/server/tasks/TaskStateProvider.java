/**
 * Provider interface for determining the active state of a task.
 * <p>
 * This interface decouples the queue lifecycle management from the task state persistence layer.
 * Implementations should check the authoritative task state to determine whether a task is
 * considered "active" for queue management purposes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A task is typically considered active if:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Its state is not final (e.g., not COMPLETED, CANCELED, FAILED, etc.), OR</li>
 *     <li>Its state is final but it was finalized recently (within a configurable grace period)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The grace period mechanism handles race conditions in both replicated and non-replicated environments
 * where events may be in-flight when a task finalizes.
 * </p>
